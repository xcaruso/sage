    Return the genus of two times a quadratic form over `\ZZ`.

    These are defined by a collection of local genus symbols (a la
    Chapter 15 of Conway-Sloane [CS1999]_), and a signature.

def local_genus_symbol(self, p):
    r"""
    Return the Conway-Sloane genus symbol of 2 times a quadratic form
    defined over `\ZZ` at a prime number `p`.

    This is defined (in the class
    :class:`~sage.quadratic_forms.genera.genus.Genus_Symbol_p_adic_ring`)
    to be a list of tuples (one for each Jordan component
    `p^m\cdot A` at `p`, where `A` is a unimodular symmetric matrix with
    coefficients the `p`-adic integers) of the following form:

    - If `p>2`, then return triples of the form [`m`, `n`, `d`] where

      - `m` = valuation of the component

      - `n` = rank of `A`

      - `d` = det(`A`) in {1, `u`} for normalized quadratic non-residue `u`.

    - If `p=2`, then return quintuples of the form [`m`, `n`, `s`, `d`, `o`] where

      - `m` = valuation of the component

      - `n` = rank of `A`

      - `d` = det(`A`) in {1, 3, 5, 7}

      - `s` = 0 (or 1) if `A` is even (or odd)

      - `o` = oddity of `A` (= 0 if `s` = 0) in `\ZZ/8\ZZ` = the trace of the diagonalization of `A`

    .. NOTE::

        The Conway-Sloane convention for describing the prime `p = -1`
        is not supported here, and neither is the convention for
        including the 'prime' Infinity.  See note on p370 of Conway-Sloane
        (3rd ed) [CS1999]_ for a discussion of this convention.

    INPUT:

    - ``p`` -- a prime number > 0

    OUTPUT:

    a Conway-Sloane genus symbol at `p`, which is an
    instance of the class :class:`~sage.quadratic_forms.genera.genus.Genus_Symbol_p_adic_ring`.
